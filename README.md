# Spam Detection Using Natural language processing (NLP) & Naive Bayes Multinomial

This project involves creating an application for spam detection using NLP & a Naive Bayes Multinomial model. The application utilizes Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface.

## Project Contents

1. `Spam Detection Application.py`: The main file of the Streamlit application.
2. `spam_classifier_model.joblib`: The trained model saved in joblib format.
3. `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the application.
4. `README.md` (this file): Instructions and project description.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/nassimaitdihim/Spam-Detection-Using-NLP-MNB.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd Spam Detection Using NLP & MNB`
3. Install the required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:
`streamlit run app.py`
2. Open your web browser and access the URL provided in the console.

## Features

- Users can enter a message in the interface.
- The spam detection model predicts whether the message is spam or not.
- The prediction result is displayed on the screen.
